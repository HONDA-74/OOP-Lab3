# 🧪 OOP Lab 3 – C++  
This repository contains Lab 3 of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course using C++ as part of the ITI 9-Month Program.

## 📌 Lab Overview  
Lab 3 builds on previous labs and starts bridging toward OOP fundamentals.  
In this lab you will practice intermediate C++ programming techniques that prepare you for object-oriented design.

## 📝 What This Lab Covers  
According to `main.cpp` in this lab:

- Usage of **functions** to encapsulate logic and improve code reusability  
- Working with **arrays and loops** to manage collections of data  
- Applying **conditional logic and branching** to handle different scenarios  
- Basic data handling and processing tasks — combining input, logic, and output in a coherent program  

This lab focuses on writing clean, modular, and structured C++ code, getting you comfortable with building more complex console-based programs, before transitioning to classes and objects.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
By completing Lab 3, you will:  
- Strengthen logic structuring skills (loops, conditions, arrays, functions)  
- Practice dividing code into reusable parts (functions) for clarity and maintainability  
- Gain confidence in writing larger procedural programs in C++  
- Prepare solid foundation for upcoming OOP concepts (classes, inheritance, etc.)
